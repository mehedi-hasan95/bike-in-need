                        <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">
                            There are different ways to manage a state in a React application. The ways are:
                            1. Local State 
                            2. Global State 
                            3. Server State
                            4. URL State
                            <p><strong>Local State -</strong> Local state is often managed in React using the useState hook. Local state is the data that we manage in one or the other component.</p>
                            <p><strong>Global State â€“</strong> Global state is data that we manage across multiple components. That is, we use global state when we want to update data from any one place in our app.</p>
                            <p><strong>Server State -</strong> Data coming from an external server must be integrated with our UI state.</p>
                            <p><strong>URL State -</strong> The data that exists in our URL, including pathnames and query parameters.</p>
                        </p>

                        <summary className="px-4 py-6 cursor-pointer focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-violet-400">How does prototypical inheritance work?</summary>
                        <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">Prototypical inheritance is something that one person inherits from another. As we take as a practical example grandfather's property father will get, father's property I will get. Prototypal inheritance is the method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.</p>

                        <summary className="px-4 py-6 cursor-pointer focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-violet-400">What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?</summary>
                        <p className="px-4 py-6 pt-0 ml-4 -mt-4 dark:text-gray-400">Unit testing is a very important part of the programming world. The development process is where the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently verified to operate correctly. Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help identify early errors in code that may be more difficult to find in later testing phases.</p>
